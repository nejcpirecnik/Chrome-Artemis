 **WARNING** - As of 2021, this script no longer works. Thanks to [hak5darren](https://github.com/hak5darren) and [carbziesss](https://github.com/carbziesssn) you can downloaded the updated version [here](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Windows-10-2021---Chrome-and-WIFI-password-Stealer-2.0).
 The version on my GitHub profile will no-longer work. Carbziesss has updated the script to work with Windows 10 without internet access.
 Thank you Carbziesss for updating the project and thanks to the Hak5 team for their tools :)

 **Chrome Artemis v1** is a script built for the [Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe") that collects saved passwords from a Windows machine and emails them to your SMTP address!

What **Chrome Artemis v1** does:

  - Makes and exception in Windows Denfender
  - Downloads the required programs
  - Saves passwords to a .txt file
  - Email the .txt file to your Gmail account
  - Deletes downloaded programs

You can also:
  - Modify the script so it sends the .txt to a server via FTP.
  - Anything you really want

## Installation
- Open the Core folder.
- Edit Chrome.ps1 and follow the comments I've added.
- Upload the Chrome.ps1 to a file sharing service such as AnonFiles.
- Open Script.txt
- Replace "Chrome.ps1 DOWNLOAD LINK HERE" with your MediaFire Download link for Chrome.ps1. Keep the "".
- Save your .txt and encode it for Rubber Ducky.
- Put the encoded .bin on your Ducky!

You don't need Twin Duck! All files are downloaded from the web. Just modify and encode the **Script.txt** and drop the encoded .bin to your Ducky!

## Usage

Just plug in the Rubber Ducky and wait. After the script runs, it'll lock the user's screen and delete the downloaded files.
